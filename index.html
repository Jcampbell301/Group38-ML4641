<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>While it is unlikely that wildfires are preventable, with appropriate action, the damages done can be reduced. To do this, there needs to be proactive action in conjunction with better indicators for wildfire risk. Our project seeks to identify these variables and create a predictive model to classify the susceptibility of an area to wildfires. </p>
